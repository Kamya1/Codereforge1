The API error response contains a `failed_generation` field with the actual JSON. Need to:

1. In `callAI` function, when response is not ok:
   - Parse the error JSON
   - Extract `error.failed_generation` field
   - Parse that escaped JSON string
   - Return it

2. In the JSON parsing section:
   - Handle escaped JSON strings (with \n, \u003c, etc.)
   - Unescape before parsing
